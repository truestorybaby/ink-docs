## ink! `v4.0.0-beta` 🦑

We released the ink! [`v4.0.0-beta`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta) 🎉

The focus of this beta release was to establish the stable ABI for the final `v4.0.0`
release. It means that whilst subsequent `beta` releases may contain breaking contract
*code* changes, the ABI will remain the same so that any contract compiled and deployed
with `v4.0.0-beta` continue to be compatible with all future `v4.0.0` versions.

In order to build contracts which use ink! `v4.0.0-beta` you need to use
`cargo-contract` [`v2.0.0-beta`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta).

We also released
[`v0.22.1`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases/tag/v0.22.1)
 of the [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)., which is compatible with the
`v4.0.0-beta` release.

## Parity Retreat in Sardinia 🌞

Our team (and Parity as a whole) spent a few days enjoying the warmth and sunshine of
Sardinia.

We talked about the road towards a stable ink! `v4.0` release, improvements to the non-Rust
developer experience, and ways to improve the adoption of ink!. Keep an eye out on the
next few updates to see the fruits of these discussions.

These in-person get togethers are especially valuable bonding experience for a global
team like ours. As of this writing we're spread across eight different countries!

## Shilling at Sub0 🗣️

Alex and German had a fireside chat session at [Sub0](https://sub0.polkadot.network/), the Polkadot Developer conference.

We're still waiting for the recoding to be uploaded, and we'll share that link here when
it's available!

## ink! x OpenZeppelin 🔏
The Polkadot council approved a [treasury proposal](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/council/motion/296) funding
[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)'s review and audit of ink! and the Contracts pallet.

The tl;dr here is that OpenZeppelin will be taking a look at ink! as a language and will
give some recommendations for how to make the language safer.

We'll be sharing more about this in the upcoming weeks once the review gets started!
